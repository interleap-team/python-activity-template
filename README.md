## 1. Setting Up Codespace for Jupyter Notebook

### Prerequisites
1. A GitHub account.
2. Basic familiarity with using GitHub and Codespaces.

### Steps to Create a Codespace
1. **Open Repository**: Navigate to this repository in your GitHub account.
2. **Create Codespace**: Click the `Code` button, select the `Codespaces` tab, and then click `Create codespace on main`.
3. **Install Jupyter Notebook Extension**:  
   - Once the Codespace is open, go to the **Extensions** view (on the sidebar, look for the square icon with four boxes).
   - Search for **Jupyter Notebook** (developed by Microsoft) and install it.
4. **Set Kernel to Python Environment**:  
   - Open any `.ipynb` file from the repository in the Codespace.
   - At the top-right corner of the Jupyter Notebook interface, click on the `Kernel` dropdown.
   - Select the Python environment created in your Codespace (e.g., `Python 3 (ipykernel)`).
   - This will ensure your notebooks are ready to run Python code.

## 2. Activities

### Overview
Before diving into the project exercises, it's essential to complete the activities. These activities are designed to familiarize you with the basics of Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib.

### Available Activities
1. **Basics of Jupyter Notebook**: Learn how to navigate and write basic Python code in Jupyter Notebook.
   - File: `activities/1.1-basic-jupyter-notebook.ipynb`
2. **Introduction to Matplotlib**: Explore Matplotlib and create basic visualizations.
   - File: `activities/1.2-using-matplotlib.ipynb`

### Steps to Complete Activities
1. Open the activity files from the `activities` folder in your Codespace.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook cells.
3. Experiment with the examples and try out additional code as needed.

## 3. Project: Exercises on Matplotlib

### Overview
The project file contains a set of exercises related to Matplotlib. These exercises build on the skills you developed in the activities and are meant to test your understanding and creativity.

### Steps to Complete the Project
1. Open the project file:
   - File: `project/project.ipynb`
2. Carefully read the instructions for each exercise.
3. Complete the exercises by writing your solutions in the code cells provided.

## 4. Submitting Your Work

### Submission Guidelines
1. Save your completed project file with all solutions in the `src` folder.  
   - Recommended filename: `matplotlib_exercises_solution.ipynb`.
2. Ensure all cells are executed, and outputs are visible in the notebook.
3. Push your updated `src` folder to the repository.


### Goal

You do not have to be afraid of errors. Instead, feel free to make as many of them as possible in this codespace. You cannot go wrong, and if you do, you can always create a new, fresh codespace. The idea is for you to get familiar with the code and basics.

If you feel you are stuck, feel free to ask for help.
